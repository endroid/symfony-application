## Programming


* Put required entity properties in the constructor
* Entities and models only maintain state
    * Operations on the state are performed by other objects
    * Use getters and setters instead of public properties
        * Not always valuable, but ensures a consistent interface
    * Changes should be immediate
        * Use UUIDs to avoid the need to wait for object creation
        * Events and views should be generated by a separate process
            * Can be asynchronously or even in another application
        * Provide means to force immediate event or view generation
            * Some views always require an actual state
            * Can in some cases be forced via invalidation
* Separate commands and view
    * Writes are allowed to be expensive, reads not
* Log changes as much as possible
    * Store deltas in a separate table
    * Save date created, updated and deleted (in case of soft delete)
    * Take care of relations (foreign keys) when using soft delete



## Symfony

* Use an asset packer when possible
    * Compress and combine assets where possible
    * Automatically bust old caches by using manifest files
    * Use a dev server like webpack that automatically updates manifest
* Always provide (a) global base template(s) for your application
    * In app/Resources/views/...
    * Do not build assets to this path (this is not a public path)
    * Build bundle specific assets within your bundles
    * Build application specific assets within your application
        * Add bundle specific assets to config to avoid multiple files
* Store your non-reusable application logic in src/AppBundle
* Store your reusable, decoupled logic in a separate bundle or namespace
    * So you can use it even if it was not specifically designed for reuse
* Store your logic in a separate repository when specifically designed for reuse
    
## Process

* Fail early: start with the most complex, unclear or risky task first
