## Programming

* Entities and models only maintain state
    * Operations on the state are performed by other objects
    * Use getters and setters instead of public properties
        * Not always valuable, but ensures a consistent interface
    * Changes should be immediate
        * Events and views should be generated by a separate process
            * Can be asynchronously or even in another application
* Separate commands and view
    * Writes are allowed to be expensive, reads not
* Log changes as much as possible
    * Store deltas in a separate table
    * Save date created, updated and deleted (in case of soft delete)
    * Take care of relations (foreign keys) when using soft delete
