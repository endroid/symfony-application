# Symfony Application

This repository serves as a base for developing web applications. It is a bit
opinionated so in the readme I explain the choices I made. In short the focus
of this code base is on code quality, performance, innovation, maintainability
and speed of development. Not so much on portability or building a solution
that fits all possible use cases.
